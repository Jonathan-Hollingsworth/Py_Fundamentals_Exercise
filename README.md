# Py_Fundamentals_Exercise
Each file contains a singular function 
## any7(nums)
Looks through a list of numbers to see if any of them are a 7  
(Returns True or False)
## convert_temp(unit_in, unit_out, temp)
Converts a given temperature(temp) from a given unit(unit_in) into its desired equivalent(unit_out)  
(unit_in and unit_out must be "f" or "c")
## count_up(start, stop)
Prints all numbers from start all the way up to (and including) stop  
(Ex. count_up(5,7) would print the following numbers [5, 6, 7])
## in_range(nums, lowest, highest)
Prints all numbers (from nums) between the lowest and highest  
(Ex. in_range([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 15, 30) would print 20 and 30 (the only numbers between 15(lowest) and 30(highest)))
## sum(nums)
Add all numbers (from nums) together and returns the total  
(sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) would return 10)
## print_upper_words(words, must_start_with)
Prints all given words that match the (must_start_with) condition in full Uppercase  
(if there is no condition given then it will print all words given)
